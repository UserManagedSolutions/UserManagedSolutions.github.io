### What inPerson does

This app allows you to register floor plans and tag each space as shared or designated. Shared spaces are self-service that users can book, while designated spaces are assigned by the admins.
Users can then leverage the information to connect with teammates, and make decisions about being present in the office on a given day.

### Installation

Install inPerson from Microsoft AppSource to the SharePoint App Catalog. Then you'll be able to sync with Teams and add the app as a tab in a Microsoft Teams team.

### Usage

The first time you open the inPerson app, under Settings click on "Initialize Data Store". The app will set up the Lists and the library needed to store the data. This will take a couple minutes and only needs to be done once for each Microsoft Teams team.

You can then start registering buildings, adding floor plans, and flagging each space as shared or designated. Users will use the interface to book spaces, get information about building occupancy, and find their teammates.
